    "reviewText":"Kyle did a wonderful job cleaning my truck. His price was extremely reasonable for the great service he provided. I was nothing but happy and impressed by the change my truck went through. I didn't even think it was that dirty, but he proved me wrong. He showed me a ton of the things you can't really see on the outside. He was always quick to respond and extremely easy to work with. One of the nicest guys you'll meet. I would highly recommend his services to anyone.",
